# Problem Statement

- Ramayana is a complex epic with many characters, relationships, and events.
- Tracking family trees, alliances, and battles manually is difficult.
- The project uses Prolog to create a logical knowledge base for automatic reasoning.

# Scope of the Project

- Represent characters, families, and relationships in the Ramayana.
- Model major events: exile, abduction, rescue, and battles.
- Query alliances, enmities, and defections among characters.
- Use logical rules for derived relations like ancestor, sibling, and allied_with.
- Demonstrate knowledge representation and rule-based reasoning.

# Target Users

- Students learning Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming.
- Teachers demonstrating expert systems and knowledge representation.
- Mythology enthusiasts interested in AI applications.
- Developers exploring rule-based querying and logical reasoning.

# High-Level Features

- Character Representation: Male, female, kings, rulers.
- Family Tree: Parent, sibling, ancestor relationships.
- Marriage & Alliances: Symmetric spouse and ally relations.
- Events: Exile, abduction, and rescue scenarios.
- Battles: Kills, weapons used, defections.
- Locations: Kingdoms, forests, and cities.
- Derived Rules: Logical queries combining multiple relationships for insights.
